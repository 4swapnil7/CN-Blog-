			<h1> WELCOME TO Classful IP Addressing </h1><br>
			  
			<p>
			IP address gives us the information about how to reach a host, not a part of our LAN.<br>
			It can be written in Dotted Decimal Notation, or Hexadecimal notation.<br>
			We're gonna learn here about the former.<br>
			(One example here.)
			</p>

			<p>
			Classful addresses, of 32 bits, are divided in five sub classes<br>
			A, B, C, D ad E.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			Now IPv4 address is divided in 2 parts.<br>
			Network ID<br>
			Host ID<br>
			</p>

			<p><i>
			Let's say a whole network/ organisation ,hospital has one network ID. <br>
			one hospital can have many devices, which are multiple individual hosts.<br>
			these hosts, here multiple users on computer or any network device, belong to this hospital network segment <br>
			</i></p>

			<p>
			<b><center>CLASS A</center></b><br>
			Network length is of 8  bits.<br>
			host length of (32-8) 24 bits.<br>
			The first bit of the 8 bit long network Id is always 0, that defines the address as A class<br>
			So now remain 7 bits to distinguish various networks.<br>
			meaning 2^7=128 networks of which 2 are special.( 0.0.0.0 and 127.x.y.z)<br>
			Hence 2^24 -2=16,777,214 host ID are a part of each network.<br>
			Range of address:  1.x.x.x – 126.x.x.x<br>
			Default subnet mask:  255.x.x.x.<br>
			used by huge universities, companies like Google, and US military.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><center>CLASS B</center></b><br>
			Network length is of 16  bits.<br>
			host length of (32-16) 16 bits.<br>
			The first TWO bitS of the 16 bit long network Id is always 10, that defines the address as B class<br>
			So now remain 14 bits to distinguish various networks.<br>
			meaning 2^14=16,384 networks <br>
			Hence 2^16 -2=16,777,214 host ID are a part of each network.<br>
			Range of address:  128.0.x.x – 191.255.x.x.<br>
			Default subnet mask: 255.255.x.x.<br>
			used by medium sized companies<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><center>CLASS C</center></b><br>
			Network length is of 24  bits.<br>
			host length of (32-24) 8 bits.<br>
			The first THREE bitS of the 24 bit long network Id is always 110, that defines the address as C class<br>
			So now remain 21 bits to distinguish various networks.<br>
			meaning 2^21=2097152 networks <br>
			Hence 2^8 -2=254 host ID are a part of each network.<br>
			Range of address:  192.0.0.x – 223.255.255.x.x.x.<br>
			Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.x.<br>
			used by small sized companies<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><center>CLASS D</center></b><br>
			No seggregation in prefix and suffix.<br>
			The first FOUR bits are always set 1110.<br>
			Interesting point is, remaining bits of address become what the hosts recognise.<br>
			Range of address: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255.<br>
			no subnet mask.<br>
			reserved for multi-casting<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><CENTER>CLASS E</CENTER></b><br>
			No seggregation in prefix and suffix.<br>
			The first FOUR bits are always set 1111.<br>
			Range of address: 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.254.<br>
			no subnet mask.<br>
			reserved for research purpose<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>REMEMBER:</b><br>
			(Not used network Id)<br>
			All bits set to 0 are not routed.<br>
			Starting with 127 as it's reserved for internal loop-back functions.<br>
			All bits set to 1 used as an IP broadcast address.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>DISADVANTAGES</b><br>
			Classful addressing has become obsolete, since many addresses are wasted due to improper distribution.<br>
			Say class A, which has only 128 networks for whole world, but needs 16777214 hosts.<br>
			now only a handful of techgiants can be this large, hardly 20-30,<br>
			so remaining 100 times 16777214 address spaces are wasted.<br>
			Class C provides only 254 host addresses for one organization, not feasible even for small companies.<br>
			Class E addresses were mostly unused, so whole class space was wasted.<br>
			So the key issue is the rigid assignment of hosts addresses to sporadic number of networks.<br>
